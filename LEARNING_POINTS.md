# Learning Points:
You learned something new? Awesome! Share it here, and let your knowledge benefit others.

## How to add your learning points:
Create a new level 2 heading `##` of the form `[github_user](github_user_link) Learned`. Then add points(and/or subpoints) on the various topics you learned.
If you want to update upon the points previously learned, then simply add more points under your name.

## [Wuraola Oyewusi](https://github.com/WuraolaOyewusi) Learned:
* These are some of the things I have learnt while creating pull requests:
	* Merge conflicts isn't as difficult as it sounds, conflict markers and diff are your friends to help recognize where the conflict(s) is/are and fix them.
	* Keep asking questions,reading others' feedbacks till you figure out what to do.
	* When sending a Pull Request(PR), always send from a new branch and not the master.This ensures that your master branch stays original and keeps your PR tidy. When I sent a PR from my master branch(the original branch where the repo was forked),the new PR included a previous PR and that's not what I wanted. So for every new PR, a new branch.
	* If a PR has been merged, treat an edit to its files as a new PR.
	* Please add what you have learnt above this line with a blank line between each point.
